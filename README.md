# Summary

Druid is a new kind of publishing platform that will run on 100% renewable energy by 2025. In addition to running on clean energy additional measures have been taken to significantly reduce energy consumption. Druid achieves this feat via eliminating infrastructure like servers and databases from the web hosting equation. In contrast to traditional websites druids run completely in the browser and communicate securely directly with resources in the cloud when necessary. Druid is designed to build the web back better on the net 0 web without sacrificing latency, availability, responsiveness, or scalability.
