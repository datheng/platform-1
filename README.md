* Magento | https://magento.com/
* Modx | https://modx.com/

### Notable Mentions

This project would not be possible without the previous work of many. Druid uses many other open source projects to deliver a sleek, sophisticated publishing experience. The most noteworthy of those is Angular â€“ https://angular.io/. The foundation for the entire suite is built on top of this modern web building framework developed by Google with global support ecosystem.

One of the primary reasons Angular has been choosen for this project is due to the rich ecosystem of modules developed by community. Many of those projects have been used to optimize development quality, performance, efficiency, and maintainance.

Formly Field panel page

State changes to form persisted to store. These changes can than be used to initiate other actions
on the page. For example, when someone changes a form value trigger a new search of data.

Tabs Page with custom labeling using selectors

Formly Kitchen sink v2 (code tabs)

https://dpxmq1mxvsyda.cloudfront.net/formly/kitchensink/v2

Version 2 of formly kitchen sink.
Adds code tabs using angular material tab component.
First proof of concept with panel page selecors and style handlers.

https://dpxmq1mxvsyda.cloudfront.net/example-tabs-custom-labels-v1

The first snippet in each tab is selected as the label for the tab.
This is made possible my the new panel page selection feature.
The panel page selection "api" eases pane mutations.
The page selection api is the drivinf force behind selecting a label for the tab.
The tabs style is the first proof of concept for the selection api and style handlers.
Style handlers are the other piece of this that can be used to dynamically change the page data structure.

Pane States

https://dpxmq1mxvsyda.cloudfront.net/test-pane-state-media-content-v1

Momentarily see loading text until image loads. Once image loads the loading text is removed.
This is done using pane states. The media content panel updates its pane state so that
the outside world in this case a rule can take action like hiding/showing content. This
is the first of many examples to follow using pane states.

!Important: There seems to be an issue hear. When the pane using a rule is part of the same panel
for the content that triggers the rule infinite context resolution loop occurs.

Table Recipe

Example of creating a table retaining all features of panel pages.

This uses the new datasource capabilities of multiple viewable content bindings. Each
column is a separate content binding on the datasource. CSS is than applied to make
the panel page components appear like a table.
