# Druid?

Druid is a new kind of publishing platform that will run on 100% renewable energy by 2025. In addition to running on clean energy additional measures have been taken to significantly reduce energy consumption. Druid achieves this feat via eliminating infrastructure like servers and databases from the web hosting equation. In contrast to traditional websites druids run completely in the browser and communicate securely directly with resources in the cloud when necessary. Druid is designed to build the web back better on the net 0 web without sacrificing latency, availability, responsiveness, or scalability.

# Behind the Name

Any D R U I D is a small, portable web app optimized for the cloud that follows five core principles.

* D ependable
  * Highly available, infinitely scalable with low-latency across all tiers.
* R esponsive
  * Performant, optimized
* U ser Centric
  * Delightful experience for everyone involved from user to developer.
* I nexpensive
  * Low-cost without sacrifice.
* D urable
  * Low dependance on specific infrastructure configurations or environments.

# Clean Tech

Druids run completely in the browser using the modern [Angular framework](https://angular.io/) developed by Google. However, druids can also host micro-frontends that are built with any modern JavaScript stack such as; [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), etc.

Druids run compeltely in the cloud. More specifically the [aws cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/) that is on track to be powered with [100% renewable energy by 2025](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/). Furthermore, druids eliminate servers, infrastructure, and databases to realize truely small, efficient web experiences on serverless technology stacks instead.

Druid follows the [principles of green software engineering](https://principles.green/).
