# Dependability

Highly available, infinitely scalable with low-latency across all tiers.

# Responsiveness

performant, optimized

# User Centric

delightful experience for everyone involved from user to developer.

# Inexpensive

Low-cost without sacrifice.

# Durablility

# Platform

![](https://smeskey-github-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/projects/druid/github/druid_identity_ng.png)

Arm builders with extensible editor for rapid realization of druid web experiences using Angular.

# Origin

The origin of druid was birthed from the desire to easily enable users to customize ad data entry and search experience. The original plan was to create a dedicated classifieds ad site that would fulfil this purpose. However, the decision was made to put that on hold to build an editor completely separate from ads,generic enough to not only support data entry but complete website generation using Angular.

The old Angular project can be found here.

The brand new druid classifieds site will be built here.
