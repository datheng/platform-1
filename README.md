# Summary

Quell is a new kind of web editor that runs entirely on sustainable energy resources. In addition to running on clean energy additional measures have been taken to significantly reduce energy consumption. Quell achieves this feat via removing infrastructure like servers and databases from the web hosting equation. In contrast to traditional websites our carbon free sites run completely in the browser and communicate securely directly with resources in the cloud when necessary. Quell is the editor of choice for [Slayful](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/druidcloud) our cloud hosted platform to rimagine the web without scope 1,2,3 emissions.

# Behind the Name

Any D R U I D is a small, portable web app optimized for the cloud that follows five core principles.

* D ependable
  * Highly available, infinitely scalable with low-latency across all tiers.
* R esponsive
  * Performant, optimized
* U ser Centric
  * Delightful experience for everyone involved from user to developer.
* I nexpensive
  * Low-cost without sacrifice.
* D urable
  * Low dependance on specific infrastructure configurations or environments.

# Clean Tech

Druids run completely in the browser using the modern [Angular framework](https://angular.io/) developed by Google. However, druids can also host micro-frontends that are built with any modern JavaScript stack such as; [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), etc.

Druids run compeltely in the sustainable cloud favoring Azure but any static site hosting service works. Furthermore, druids eliminate servers, infrastructure, and databases to realize truely small, efficient web experiences on serverless technology stacks instead.

* Druid follows the [principles of green software engineering](https://principles.green/).
* Druid is built on [sustainability pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sustainability-pillar.html) of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) [Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected).
* Druid is [serverless](https://github.com/rollthecloudinc/verti-go) favoring [zero trust](https://aws.amazon.com/security/zero-trust/) [signed requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) directly in the browser.

# Rapid Dev

Quickly realize simple and complex green web experiences using the druid platform.

## Site Builders

Site builders can create green web experiences using the druid editor without knowing how to code.

### Collect

Prototype druid form to collect and store submissions.

## Developers

Developers can use druid as an app shell to orchestrate micro-frontends built with Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Any app compatible with [module federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) can be used with druid. Module federation can also be used to extend the platform without hacking core using extensions. Extensions are Angular micro-frontends developed for the sole purpose of providing new plugin implementations.

### Orchestrate

Prototype using druid as a shell app to host Angular architects workflow designer micro-frontends.

* [Page](https://demo.druidcloud.io/workflow-designer-v2)
* [Editor](https://demo.druidcloud.io/workflow-designer-v2/manage)

### Extend

Prototype using druid to load extension with new content type at runtime from external site.

* [Editor](https://demo.druidcloud.io/tractorbeam-test-v3/manage)
