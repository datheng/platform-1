Documents strategy for turning layouts into plugins.

layouts
- split
- grid
- gridless


split / flex

settings
- expanded
- flex - flex overrides expanded - expanded - bool value

I think we can just define these as atributes and latch onto the attribute system to build the forms.

Is there any opporunity to manage css inside layouts?

hook up external file reference that is added dynamicallty maybe....
