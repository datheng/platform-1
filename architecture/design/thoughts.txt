These projects are never finished.

So does it make sense to create an identity that is finished.

Wouldn't it be better to have an identity that reflects the essence of the project it represents.

Not only in terms of symbolism and meaning but something that also isn't complete itself because it never will be.

People always have these very polished, sharp, and inorganic identities for software. 

Why when software is never complete.

To have a very polished, sharp, inorganic identiy doesn't really reflect software. Great software is constantly changing and never complete.

So lets take it a different direction. 

What is so wrong with taking sketches and using them in their raw form to represent the project.

Isn't that actually more representative of the project itself. One where we recognize, appreciate there is no finished.

For software to be finished is for it to be dead.
