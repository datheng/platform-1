Customization of default styles for layouts ands pane content.

If you create your own layout you can style it anyway you want.

What about altering the default layout styling without changing the base code?

What about changing styles in panes without altering the base code?

Inline styles would need to be applied to specific element which really sucks.

Options:

Panes:

All panes have an optional style section. The styles are added dynamically to the component. They are embedded and only affect that pane instance.

- would store css inside db.
- Can we use scss? - maybe if we compile before saving to the db, or have an alternate version of the raw styles that are compiled.

Another way to look at this…

Every page is a separate component.

If every page is a separate component styles can be associated directly with that component without affecting other instances.

The build process would need to register dynamic components. 

or...

Before the build occurs we would need to write dynamic components.... hmmm

Instead of PanelPage the it would need to be components that extend the base platform and given unique names. Those
components would also need to be dynamically registred with the platform.

At this point we are writting dynamic components before compiling the app just so that the css can changed... hmmm oh and use the preprocessor.

Every page gets its own component dynamically written to the file system.

That doesn't really solve styling at the pane level. If each components view encaps is the default the panes would also need to be written as separate components... ugh

It would need to be something like...

PanelPage__{uuid}Component

PanelPage__{uuid}__Pane__{{id}}Component

Just so that they can be styled... that seems like it would really suck.

I would also need to figure out how to dynamically add components to the build process based on some type of entity discovery process.

The build would need to loop through all pages and write dynamic component files on the physical server.

Once we do that all the scss would be compiled like it was part of a normal component.

Creating and upading pages would require a new build. How do we manage that?

You create / update a page. Those changes wouldn't be applied until the new build occurs.

The build process would need to know how to discover and write these files before building the project.

It would need to be like page_instances and every build recreates it.


page_instances
- src
-- lib
--- components
---- page_{uuid}
------ panel__{uuid}_{0001}
--------- pane__{uuid}__0001__0001
--------- pane__{uuid}__0001__0002

Once I do this what other features / advantages do I get?

Well in theory if I dynamically declare the components before the build process I can alter any part of
the component I want. For example, I could provide inputs for extending the base component with new functions
and overriding the render template itself.

I'm liking this more and more even though I have no idea how to achieve it...

We would need to make an async request to the page data source and write the components with a schema dynamically before building based on info options from each panel page.

Each page could be a separate lazy loaded module... in theory.

I mean once this is done anything can be done with the components. I can have each pane provide an extension point where people are able
to extend the base class with their own typescript code.

Panel pages become blueprints for dynamically generated components that are actually included as physical classes/components.

We could even build individual page modules based on the dependencies required.

Another option...

Allow scss and save it as media on aws s3 after compile.

Individual page/panel components can include this scss file when rendering.

The compiled css is inluded dynamically when rendering pages.

We could rollup everything into one single "page" style sheet.

Use base classes on components to target elements.

Could also compile before saving to db. Store the compiled code in db and just attach.

We need to attach relative to the host element of the targeted component, wouldn't we?

s3:

pages
-- page__{uuid}
---- styles.css
----- panel__{uuid}__001.css
----- panel__{uuid}__002.scss
----- pane__{uuid}_0001__0001.css
----- pane__{uuid}_0001__0002.css
----- pane__{uuid}_0002__0001.css
----- pane__{uuid}_0002__0002.css

ugh… maybe

... or we rollup

Either way now I need to have a styles instances that have raw and compiled.

styled: {
  raw: "",
  compiled: ""
}

I need to add an scss pre-processor to the back-end api. What options exist for go?

Other ideas...

I can't easily include styles without dynamically generating components before the build. Which sucks. I mean its flexible but its going
to require a bunch of work to figure out and complicate setup for possible users. So I think regardless how great this seems it is a no go here.

If I don't want to do that. I like the middle ground. Allow scss overrides inside pages, panels, and panes. When a page
is saved take all of that combine it into one single file and compile. When the page is accessed include the single compiled css file for that page.

The next level is each combination above has its own compiled css file. Those files will be attached at runtime
to the page.

I think the best option is the middle.

Aggregate the styles and save as one single file. When the page is viewed attach that dynamically.

layouts
panels
panes

Style overrides allowed

Those styles are rolled up into one single file and included at runtime.

We could also write a component that includes that single file. Again… requires dynamic writting of components before the build.
