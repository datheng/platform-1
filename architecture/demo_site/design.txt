my pages --- display all pages

- filtering pages????


global layout medta data could be used to add metadata for filtering like "page type"


-- for now just list all readable pages for the user.

We could also integrate with profiles instead?

deploy demo for each user? - is it even a deployment- run from lambda? - match user to site???


- each would would have a profile - automate profile creation when user registers.
- add profileId to page entity.

there can only ever be 1 creator. For simplcity it is probaly easiest to just ad creatorId to page and owner auth.

OwnerAuthorization expects userId not creatorId - thats fine.

Add endpoint to get all pages that match current users id.
- add userId for search index on pages. Add as part of lookup.

pages - list all pages
pages table/grid - what module?
